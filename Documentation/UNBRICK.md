## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites <a name=prerequisites></a>

**If you have flashed an image to the Fydetab Duo you should already have all this tools but if not,  make sure you have this in your computer:**

- [Rockchip Driver](https://dl.radxa.com/tools/windows/DriverAssitant_v5.0.zip)
- Flashing tool: You can download the tools for Linux and Mac from the official [Fydetab Duo Wiki](https://wiki.fydetabduo.com/flashing_the_fydetab_duo#utilising-the-image-flash-tool-provided-by-rockchip). For Windows you can use the last available version [here (RKDevTool vX.XX)](https://docs.radxa.com/en/rock5/rock5b/low-level-dev/rkdevtool). 
- [AOSP Fydetab DUO image (the file we are going to flash)](https://wiki.fydetabduo.com/os-release-board/aosp)

**Unzip all files so you have everything uncompressed**

## üëπ MASKROM mode <a name=maskrom></a>

**To flash any image into the Fydetab Duo we need to enter `MASKROM` mode**


**- How to enter MASKROM mode:**

- Connect the USB from the PC to the tablet
- Power off completely the tablet
- Press and hold the `Vol +`, while holding it quick press `Power` button (releasing it but not the `Vol +`), then release `Vol +`.

If you can't enter MASKROM mode this way because you have flashed some image incorrectly (happened to me) and every time you press the `Power` button the tablet turns on, then you need to open the tablet and use the inner `MASKROM` button.

Basically the steps to enter `MASKROM` mode with the button on the PCB are: 

1. Force a shutdown holding the powerbutton for 10 seconds. 
2. Press and hold the `MASKROM` mode from the PCB. While holding the button connect the USB from the tablet to the PC. 
3. Open `RKDevTool.exe` and you will see that a device is detected on MASKROM mode.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è How to flash the official images <a name=flashing_images></a>

You can download the images from the Official Wiki. After that, you can flash them with these steps: 

1. Enter MASKROM mode as explained in the previous section. 
2. Open `RKDevTool.exe` tool and go to the second tab, `Upgrade Firmware`. 
3. Click on the `Firmware` button and select the downloaded image to flash (remember to  uncompress it so it has `.img` as the extension).
4. Click on the `Upgrade` button to start the process.
